TOPIC- SQL

SQL is basically 4 simple things

CRUD

A relational database supports ultimately 

C   Creating data    CREATE, INSERT
R   Reading data     SELECT
U   Updating data    UPDATE
D   Deleting data    DELETE, DROP

Since the owner has learnt SQL in multiple classes of his school & high school, he is not making further documentation for SQL as all work done will be saved on MySQL software only.
