    Topic: Modular Operator or Modulo (%)
    To find out remainder on division
    NOTE- Modulo doesn't work on float values even if you take %f instead of %d
    Remainder can be postive or negative integer

    Topic: Floor Division (/)
    It shows quotient, aka it just shows the number we get on division without the remainder.
