TOPIC:
ls- list
If you type ls in terminal and hit enter it will show a list of all files present in the current folder
We further created a new folder pset1 under which we created a file mario_1 without any extension.
So first we have to change our directory from the current folder to the folder pset1 with the command:   cd pset1/
Now you will see the that the directory has been changed to pset1 folder present in the older folder.
And then use this command to change the file name:   mv mario_1 mario_1.c
Now you will notice the file name has been changed.

cd - change directory
cp - copy a file
mkdir - make a directory ( new folder )
mv - move or rename
rm - remove file
rmdir - remove directory
