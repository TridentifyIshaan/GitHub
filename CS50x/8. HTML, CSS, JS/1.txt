NOTES-

1. TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol
        
        IP VERSION 4-
        
            Denotion- (#.#.#.#) where # is any number between 1 & 255
            8 bits each for # which makes 32 bits in total, i.e. IP address typically is 32 bits in total.
            With this 4 billion computers can be on internet which is not a huge number as compared to number of humans
        
        IP VERSION 6-

            Uses 128 bits which helps increase that 4 billion computers to a more larger number and can be calculated via concept of Permutation & Combination.

    TCP is a different set of rules that computers adhere to solve a couple of different problems.

        1) Distinguising one type of service from another.

            80 - HTTP ( Hyper Text Transfer Protocol ) { #.#.#.#.80 }
            443 - HTTPS ( Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure ) { #.#.#.#.443 }

2. DNS - Domain Name System

    Collection of servers on the internet whose purpose in life is to convert domain names to IP addresses and maybe vice versa as well

3. URL - Uniform Resource Locator

    Example of url address:

    <Protocol>://<hostname>.<domainname>.<TLD>/foldername/<filename>.<filetype>

    Host name- like www.
    The single slashes are called path
    TLD- Top Level Domain like .com, .edu, .net, .gov, etc..
    Country Code TLD ( CCTLD ) - .uk, .in, ,jp, etc...
